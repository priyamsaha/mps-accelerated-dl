# MPS/GPU-Accelerated Deep Learning Training Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the implementation and analysis of a comprehensive deep learning benchmarking system designed to compare CPU versus MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) GPU performance for neural network training. The implementation provides a robust framework for evaluating hardware acceleration benefits in machine learning workloads using PyTorch.

## 1. Implementation Overview

### 1.1 System Architecture

The implementation follows a modular, object-oriented design consisting of three primary components:

**CNNModel Class**: A convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for image classification tasks, featuring:
- Three convolutional layers with progressive channel expansion (3→32→64→128)
- Max pooling layers for spatial dimension reduction
- Three fully connected layers for classification
- Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting

**DeepLearningBenchmark Class**: The core benchmarking engine that orchestrates:
- Dataset preparation and loading
- Device detection and management
- Training loop execution
- Performance metrics collection
- Results analysis and reporting

**Main Function**: Entry point that configures and executes the complete benchmark suite.

### 1.2 Technical Specifications

- **Framework**: PyTorch 2.0+ with torchvision
- **Supported Datasets**: CIFAR-10 and MNIST
- **Model Architecture**: Custom CNN with 1.2M+ parameters
- **Training Configuration**: Adam optimizer, StepLR scheduler, CrossEntropyLoss
- **Hardware Support**: CPU and MPS (Apple Silicon) devices

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1 Model Architecture Design

The CNN model implements a classical architecture pattern optimized for image classification:

```
Input (3x32x32) → Conv1(32) → Pool → Conv2(64) → Pool → Conv3(128) → Pool → FC(512) → FC(256) → FC(10)
```

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Progressive feature map expansion to capture hierarchical features
- Strategic dropout placement (50%) to balance regularization and performance
- Appropriate kernel sizes (3x3) for optimal feature extraction
- ReLU activation functions for computational efficiency

### 2.2 Device Management Strategy

The implementation incorporates sophisticated device detection and management:

**MPS Detection Logic**:
```python
self.mps_available = torch.backends.mps.is_available()
if self.mps_available:
    self.mps_device = torch.device("mps")
    # Memory and device count reporting
```

**Graceful Fallback**: The system automatically falls back to CPU-only benchmarking when MPS is unavailable, ensuring broad compatibility across hardware configurations.
